Based on Cocoa with Love article:
"A simple, extensible HTTP server in Cocoa".
http://www.cocoawithlove.com/2009/07/simple-extensible-http-server-in-cocoa.html

This is a Swift version of HTTP server that is doing following:
- Opening a socket for listening
- Receiving incoming connections
- Handling response (returning 501)

### Getting Started
There are two options to run HTTP Swift Server:
- **Xcode:** Open Xcode and run the project.
- **Terminal:** Run `swift main.swift`. This will execute Swift code. Make sure that Swift toolchain is added to the PATH.
